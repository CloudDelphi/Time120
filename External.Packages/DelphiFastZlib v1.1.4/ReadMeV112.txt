Version 1.1.2

Hello,

you can found an optimized version of Zlib 1.1.4 that you can embed into every Delphi executable without use external dlls.
Further I have build a little example hoping to aid "young" Delphi programmers getting in trouble with streams...

Please let me know if you found errors.

These objects and sources are targeted for executing into P6+ CPU core, and Delphi5-6-7 software.

Cheers,
